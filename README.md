# THPS3-Randomizer
A randomizer for the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 for the PSx for use with Archipelago.

Currently, the main randomizer is not finished. Instead, a Manual apworld by BombsGoBoom is being used. You can use that in conjunction with THPS3_Manual_Menu.lua . The Manual Menu can be dragged onto the Bizhawk window while THPS3 is running.

# Manual Menu Lua
The Manual Menu lua works as a soft cheat engine companion to the manual apworld. It allows overwriting level selection (for level rando), quick toggle of cheats (for cheat traps), and easy checking which goals have been completed and which stats and decks have been collected.

To install, simply drag the lua file onto the Bizhawk window while THPS3 is running. Bizhawk 2.9 is suggested, as this lua file was tested on Bizhawk 2.9.1 . You can open the menu while not skating (main menus or paused) by pressing the Select button. While in the menu, L1 and R1 change what is selected, R2 selects the current option, L2 goes back, and Select exits the menu while saving the current menu location. The level menu selects which level you want to go to. To actually go to that level, you must select Foundry from the normal level select screen in-game.
